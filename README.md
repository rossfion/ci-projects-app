A mashup of two projects created with CodeIgniter 3

The original project is offered by Udemy instructor Edwin Diaz as part of his "PHP MVC Framework CodeIgniter for Beginners Project".

I added a MY_Controller to the core folder; may add a MY_Model later.

I also added a facility for email confirmation when a new user registers to use the app, using CodeIgniter's built-in Email Class. The original code for this section of the app comes from Codecourse's YouTube course on building a registration and login app using CodeIgniter.
